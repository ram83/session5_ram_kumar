# This assignment explains about arguments, parameters, pass by value, reference

# Named Arguments
To reduce the necessity to know the order of arguments in a function, Python allows named arguments. When you call a function, you can precede some or all of the arguments by a name and an equal sign, to let the function know exactly which argument you are passing to the function
# Positional Arguments
An argument is a variable, value or object passed to a function or method as input. Positional arguments are arguments that need to be included in the proper position or order. ... An example of positional arguments can be seen in Python's complex() function.
# Default Arguments
Python has a different way of representing syntax and default values for function arguments. Default values indicate that the function argument will take that value if no argument value is passed during function call. The default value is assigned by using assignment(=) operator of the form keywordname=value.
# 'squared_power'
This Function will calculate the power operation based on the user input. Time taken for different itterations will be calculated
# 'polygon_area'
Area of polygon will be calculated, it will be itterated over n number of itterations and average time taken will be calculated

# 'temp_converter'
Average time taken for conversion of F to C and C to F will be calculated over n itterations
# speed_converter'
Average time taken to convert speed from Km/Hr to other scales over n itterations

# using inbuilt print function

The in-built print function will be itterated over n itterations specified by user and avergae of the excution time is calculated

# *args
The special syntax *args in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. It is used to pass a non-keyworded, variable-length argument list.

# **kwargs
The special syntax **kwargs in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list. We use the name kwargs with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them). It uses id, value pairs to pass
